# VolumeViewerPlugin
View plugin for volumetric image data

This plugin is made using vtk 8.2 and requires vtk 8.2.  Other versions of vtk could work but are not tested.

If the program is to be run in debug, make sure the vtk library is also build in debug, otherwise the program will crash due to a mismatch. (same for the other way around)
